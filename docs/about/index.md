# About me

## Introduction
 
As a bit background, I was born and raised in Montréal and am of Honduran descent. I am a first generation graduate student, and my interest in physics initially began my physics courses in CÉGEP years (a college instituion between high school and university exclusive to the province of Quebec's education system). I am mostly fascinated by the theoretical and mathematical foundations of different physical models, especially within the fields of astrophysics and particle physics.

Besides science, I am an avid supported of football (soccer) and am a great fan of FC Barcelona. I also like to play video games on my free time, especially story driven ones. Lastly, I am a firm believer of keeping oneself active to help clear the mind and be able to have a sharp focus, and am thus regularly go to gym (at least 5 times a week, although my actual goal is train 6 times a week).
