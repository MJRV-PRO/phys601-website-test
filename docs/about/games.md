# Video Games

I think that video games are a great way to decompress, and they allow me to immerse myself into new and fanstastical worlds. As I mentioned on my [about me](./about/about.md) page, I particularly fond of story driven games, with the Batman Arkham collection being perhaps my favourite set of games of all time.
