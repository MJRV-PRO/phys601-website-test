# Football

I find it relaxing to watch the beautiful game, but I also think that it allows me to use my brain in another fashion as I like to think a lot about the tactics and positions on the field. I am a firm defender of the Cruyffying or Tiki-Taka style of play, as I just think that it is the most enjoyable football to watch.
