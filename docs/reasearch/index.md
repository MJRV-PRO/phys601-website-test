## Decaying DM project
From many astrophysical and cosmological measurements, it is clear that there exists a type of mat-
ter, known as dark matter (DM), that makes up around 85% of the total matter content in the universe.
However, the microphysical nature of this type of matter is still unknown, and there are many different
models and candidates seeking to explain it spanning over 80 orders of magnitude in eV[@Bertone_2018]. As such, setting constraints on these various theories and their potential observables is crucial, as it narrows down the possible characteristics of DM, whilst also highlighting the promising avenues for actual experiments.

In this same spirit, during my MSc project, I will set bounds on the parameter space for a decaying DM
model via observational data of galactic and cosmological structure formation. More concretely, the model that I will be considering is one in which DM is made of particles that can exist in either of two mass states mχ1 & mχ2 such that they differ in mass by a mass splitting of δ. The decaying aspect of this model is related to the fact that the mχ2 state can decay into the mχ1 state via a 3-body decay which also produces an electron-positron pair. Computing the rate and products of these decay processes is in fact what constrains the model. Indeed, the production of mχ1 particles from mχ2 particles should have observable impacts on the structure formation in the universe. This is because as these mχ1 are produced, they get a velocity boost which can then suppress their ability to clump together, and hence affect how galaxies and galaxy clusters form.
