My name is Marlon Josue Rivera Valladares and I am a first year Master of Science in Physics student at McGill University in Montr\u00e9al, Qu\u00e9bec, Canada.</p> <p>As my field of studies suggest, I am a person interested in discovering how and why things function the way they do, to try to make a sense of the world in which we live. I am currently working on the exploration of dark matter (DM) with Professor Katelin Schutz as part of the DMcGill group. My work is mainly focused on trying to acertain if different DM models are allowed or viable from a theoretical standpoint and from observational constraints.</p> <p>If you want to know more about me and my more general interests, you can visit my about me page.

I am a first generation graduate student, and my interest in physics initially began my physics courses in C\u00c9GEP years (a college instituion between high school and university exclusive to the province of Quebec's education system). I am mostly fascinated by the theoretical and mathematical foundations of different physical models, especially within the fields of astrophysics and particle physics.</p> <p>Besides science, I am an avid supported of football (soccer) and am a great fan of FC Barcelona. I also like to play video games on my free time, especially story driven ones. Lastly, I am a firm believer of keeping oneself active to help clear the mind and be able to have a sharp focus, and am thus regularly go to gym (at least 5 times a week, although my actual goal is train 6 times a week).</p>"},{"location":"about/#other-interests","title":"Other Interests","text":"<ul> <li>Football</li> <li>Video Games</li> <li>Gym</li> </ul>"},{"location":"about/#cv","title":"CV","text":""},{"location":"about/football/","title":"Football","text":"<p>I find it relaxing to watch the beautiful game, but I also think that it allows me to use my brain in another fashion as I like to think a lot about the tactics and positions on the field.

However, the microphysical nature of this type of matter is still unknown, and there are many different models and candidates seeking to explain it spanning over 80 orders of magnitude in eV<sup>1</sup>. As such, setting constraints on these various theories and their potential observables is crucial, as it narrows down the possible characteristics of DM, whilst also highlighting the promising avenues for actual experiments.</p> <p>In this same spirit, during my MSc project, I will set bounds on the parameter space for a decaying DM model via observational data of galactic and cosmological structure formation. More concretely, the model that I will be considering is one in which DM is made of particles that can exist in either of two mass states m\u03c71 &amp; m\u03c72 such that they differ in mass by a mass splitting of \u03b4. The decaying aspect of this model is related to the fact that the m\u03c72 state can decay into the m\u03c71 state via a 3-body decay which also produces an electron-positron pair. Computing the rate and products of these decay processes is in fact what constrains the model. Indeed, the production of m\u03c71 particles from m\u03c72 particles should have observable impacts on the structure formation in the universe. This is because as these m\u03c71 are produced, they get a velocity boost which can then suppress their ability to clump together, and hence affect how galaxies and galaxy clusters form.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Gianfranco Bertone and Dan Hooper.
